Further Development
===================

With this project we have created an simple simulation for the island. The
project opens up for further development where additional variables can be
added. We have discussed the options for features such as:

Climate features
----------------

- Sea level raise. The sea level could raise in certain intervals, transforming island cells to ocean cells.
- Temperature increase and decrease. This could affect the animal's fitness and thus their ability to migrate, procreate and feed.

Animal features
---------------

- Additional species such as *birds* that do not yield to the same movement restrictions. Birds could potentially move further each year, and across all landscape types.
- Breeding features such as implementation of more defined breeding cycles. With inspiration from "`lemenår <https://snl.no/lemenår>`_". this can be done by tweaking parameters in relevant years.
